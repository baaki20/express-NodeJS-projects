# Task Manager Backend

This is the backend server for a Task Manager application. Built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**, this backend API handles task management functionality, including the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of tasks. 

## Features

- **GET**: Retrieve a list of tasks or details of a specific task
- **POST**: Create a new task
- **PUT**: Replace an existing task with updated data
- **PATCH**: Update specific fields of an existing task
- **DELETE**: Remove a task from the database

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime
- **Express.js**: Web framework for handling HTTP requests

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/baaki20/express-NodeJS-projects.git
   cd 'Task Manager'
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables as needed, typically including the following:

   - `PORT`: Port number on which the server runs
   - `DATABASE_URL`: Connection string for your database

4. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## API Endpoints

### Task Endpoints

1. **Get all tasks**

   ```http
   GET /api/v1/tasks
   ```

2. **Get a single task by ID**

   ```http
   GET /api/v1/tasks/:id
   ```

3. **Create a new task**

   ```http
   POST /api/v1/tasks
   ```

4. **Update a task by replacing all fields**

   ```http
   PUT /api/v1/tasks/:id
   ```

5. **Update specific fields of a task**

   ```http
   PATCH /api/v1/tasks/:id
   ```

6. **Delete a task**

   ```http
   DELETE /api/v1/tasks/:id
   ```

Each endpoint follows REST principles and returns appropriate HTTP status codes based on the outcome of the request.

## Error Handling

The API returns structured error responses for invalid requests, including appropriate status codes (e.g., 404 for not found, 400 for bad request). Detailed error messages help with debugging and understanding the issue.

## Future Enhancements

- **User Authentication**: Adding authentication to secure endpoints
- **Task Prioritization and Categorization**: Enhancing tasks with priority and category tags
- **Pagination and Filtering**: To manage large sets of tasks efficiently
